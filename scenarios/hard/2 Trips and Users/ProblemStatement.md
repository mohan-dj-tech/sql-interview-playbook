# Problem: Trips and Users

## Table: Trips

| Column Name | Type     |
|-------------|----------|
| id          | int      |
| client_id   | int      |
| driver_id   | int      |
| city_id     | int      |
| status      | enum     |
| request_at  | date     |

`id` is the primary key for this table.
The table holds all taxi trips. Each trip has a unique `id`, while `client_id` and `driver_id` are foreign keys to the `users_id` at the `Users` table.
`Status` is an ENUM type of ('completed', 'cancelled_by_driver', 'cancelled_by_client').

## Table: Users

| Column Name | Type     |
|-------------|----------|
| users_id    | int      |
| banned      | enum     |
| role        | enum     |

`users_id` is the primary key for this table.
The table holds all users. Each user has a unique `users_id`, and `role` is an ENUM type of ('client', 'driver', 'partner').
`banned` is an ENUM type of ('Yes', 'No').

## Task

The cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests with unbanned users by the total number of requests with unbanned users on that day.

Write a solution to find the cancellation rate of requests with unbanned users (both client and driver must not be banned) each day between "2013-10-01" and "2013-10-03". Round `Cancellation Rate` to two decimal points.

## Example

**Input:**

`Trips` table:
| id | client_id | driver_id | city_id | status              | request_at |
|----|-----------|-----------|---------|---------------------|------------|
| 1  | 1         | 10        | 1       | completed           | 2013-10-01 |
| 2  | 2         | 11        | 1       | cancelled_by_driver | 2013-10-01 |
| 3  | 3         | 12        | 6       | completed           | 2013-10-01 |
| 4  | 4         | 13        | 6       | cancelled_by_driver | 2013-10-01 |
| 5  | 1         | 10        | 1       | completed           | 2013-10-02 |
| 6  | 2         | 11        | 6       | completed           | 2013-10-02 |
| 7  | 3         | 12        | 6       | completed           | 2013-10-02 |
| 8  | 2         | 12        | 12      | completed           | 2013-10-03 |
| 9  | 3         | 10        | 12      | completed           | 2013-10-03 |
| 10 | 4         | 13        | 12      | cancelled_by_driver | 2013-10-03 |

`Users` table:
| users_id | banned | role   |
|----------|--------|--------|
| 1        | No     | client |
| 2        | Yes    | client |
| 3        | No     | client |
| 4        | No     | client |
| 10       | No     | driver |
| 11       | No     | driver |
| 12       | No     | driver |
| 13       | No     | driver |

**Output:**

| Day        | Cancellation Rate |
|------------|-------------------|
| 2013-10-01 | 0.33              |
| 2013-10-02 | 0.00              |
| 2013-10-03 | 0.50              |
