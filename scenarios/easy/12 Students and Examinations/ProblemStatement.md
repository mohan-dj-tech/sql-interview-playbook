# Problem: Students and Examinations

## Problem Statement

Table: `Students`
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| student_id    | int     |
| student_name  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
```
`student_id` is the primary key for this table.

Table: `Subjects`
```
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| subject_name | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
```
`subject_name` is the primary key for this table.

Table: `Examinations`
```
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| student_id   | int     |
| subject_name | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
```
There is no primary key for this table; it may contain duplicates. Each row indicates that a student attended an exam.

Write a solution to find the number of times each student attended each exam. Return the result table ordered by `student_id` and `subject_name`.

## Example

**Input:**

`Students` table:
```
+------------+--------------+
| student_id | student_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 1          | Alice        |
| 2          | Bob          |
| 13         | John         |
| 6          | Alex         |
+------------+--------------+
```

`Subjects` table:
```
+--------------+
| subject_name |
+--------------+
| Math         |
| Physics      |
| Programming  |
+--------------+
```

`Examinations` table:
```
+------------+--------------+
| student_id | subject_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 1          | Math         |
| 1          | Physics      |
| 1          | Programming  |
| 2          | Programming  |
| 1          | Physics      |
| 1          | Math         |
| 13         | Math         |
| 13         | Programming  |
| 13         | Physics      |
| 2          | Math         |
| 1          | Math         |
+------------+--------------+
```

**Expected Output:**
```
+------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| student_id | student_name | subject_name | attended_exams |
+------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| 1          | Alice        | Math         | 3              |
| 1          | Alice        | Physics      | 2              |
| 1          | Alice        | Programming  | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Math         | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Physics      | 0              |
| 2          | Bob          | Programming  | 1              |
| 6          | Alex         | Math         | 0              |
| 6          | Alex         | Physics      | 0              |
| 6          | Alex         | Programming  | 0              |
| 13         | John         | Math         | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Physics      | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Programming  | 1              |
+------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+
```

**Explanation:**
The query needs to count the number of exam attempts for every student-subject combination, including those with zero attempts. This requires a `CROSS JOIN` between `Students` and `Subjects` to generate all possible pairs, followed by a `LEFT JOIN` with `Examinations` to count the attempts.
